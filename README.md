# Virtual Operating System

A virtual operating system designed to run on top of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The operating system features include, but are not limited to, priority-based process scheduling, device management, process messaging, and virtual memory implementation.

The virtual OS must be run in a java compiler. With a compiler installed, first compile all files, then enter 'Java Main' to run the program.
