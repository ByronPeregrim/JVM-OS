PageSwap:
    GetRandomProcess:
        processMap size gets smaller and smaller. Reducing the number of
        processes to get from random process. The process array gets smaller
        and smaller, so the # of processes with an active physical page gets smaller
        and smaller, until eventually the process array is 0 and the while loop 
        gets stuck in an infinite loop because virtualIndex is perpetually -1

How to fix?
    Figure out why processMap is getting smaller and smaller. 
    Fixed issue. HashMap copy was affecting original when changed.

A little less than half of the Piggys memory is being overwritten with zeros.
    Possible Causes? 
        When a process reads, it takes a virtual address. It checks TLB for the corresponding
        physical address. If its not there, it does a GetMapping. GetMapping is an OS call
        that goes all the way down to the KernelandProcess.
        in KernelandProcess, GetMapping checks virtToPhysPageMap for a physicalPageNumber 
        at the given virtual index. If it doesnt exists, checks for unused physical page in the 
        kernels boolean array. If there isnt one of those, performs a page swap.
        Page swap is an OS call that goes down to the scheduler.
        Page swap gets random process, and looks for active physical page in that processes virtToPhyMap.
        If it finds an active page, it returns the virtualIndex for that page. If it does not
        find an active page, it finds a new random process and tries again until it finds an active page.
        The virtualMapping is returned. Data is read from physicalPage on virtualMapping.
        Data is written to disk. Disk page number is stored in virtualMapping.
        Page swap appears to be working as intended.
        Back in GetMapping. I set Strings before, during, and after pageswap. Why is page swaps String
        triggering 100 times between the strings before and after??? 
        I forgot about the PageSwap call in the allocateMemory function in the Kernel Class.
        Need to test that this is working properly. It is working properly, and that accounts for the large amount
        of triggers. 
        Page swap appears to be working properly in the KernelandProcess GetMapping function.
        It looks for random active physical page. Reads memory from physical page and writes it to disk.
        It stores the diskPageNumber in the victim mapping if it didnt have one already, changes the victims
        physicalPageNumber to -1. Then it returns the victims old physical page number.
        Now, in GetMapping after page swap, we update the physical page number.
        Next, we check if mapping has a diskPageNumber. If it does, we read in data from that disk page 
        and store that data in our mappings physicalPage. 
        In the case that diskPageNumber exists, system reads data in from disk and writes to memory
        In the case that diskPageNumber does not exists, fill memory with zeros
        It seems that GetMapping is working as well..
        Tracing GetMapping back to its original call in the UserlandProcess...

        There is some issue that occurs in the process of writing a mappings physical memory out to disk,
        and then reading it back in once that process is activated again. Processes are reading in zeros
        when they should be reading in the bytes that were read in from the disk.

        Piggy2 is fucking up in the Read after its been overwritten, its physical page has been set to -1, its disk page set
        to the disk page number, and its physical page written to disk. WHich ive tested and 
        all of that appears to be working. So I'm thinking that the issue occurs after the Read is initiated.
        
        Not finding anything written in the data read from disk.

        Scheduler : 387 :  Data is getting moved all out of frame. The byte that is written to the disk should
        be at the same offset from the page. Instead, the disk is reading it at an offset all over the place.
        So when the data is being written to the disk. it is not being aligned properly with each page.

        HEHEHEHEH I DID IT. ReadFromMemory and WriteToMemory were not converting page number to physical address...
